Apart from the smart contracts code, there is a software needed, that handles the networking and messaging of the off-chain transactions.

Therefore, we are currently developing the [Raiden Client](raiden).

The technology is implemented as a service that runs alongside an Ethereum node. The service has an API which offers to manage deposits, initiate transfers and check on their success. End users interact with the service only indirectly by using applications that are based on the Raiden Network.
